# ÎπÑÌä∏ÎßàÏä§ÌÅ¨ / Bitwise Algorithms

## üìå Definition

**Bitwise algorithms** manipulate the individual bits of data directly using bitwise operators. These are highly efficient in terms of speed and memory because operations are executed at the hardware level in the CPU's Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).  
They are useful for optimization, encoding/decoding, and solving complex problems in competitive programming.

## üß† How It Works

Bitwise algorithms perform calculations using **binary representation** of numbers and **bitwise operators** such as:
- `&` (AND)
- `|` (OR)
- `^` (XOR)
- `~` (NOT)
- `<<` (Left Shift)
- `>>` (Right Shift)

These operations are used to:
- Modify individual bits
- Set/unset/toggle bits
- Extract or encode data
- Perform fast multiplication/division by powers of two

## ‚è± Time and Space Complexity

| Operation                     | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Bitwise operations (AND/OR/NOT/XOR, shifts) | O(1)             | O(1)              |
| Counting set bits (na√Øve)    | O(log n)         | O(1)              |
| Advanced bit manipulations   | O(1) to O(log n) | O(1)              |

- You need to **store flags or states** in a compact way.
- You are solving problems involving **subsets, masks**, or **binary encoding**.
- You are dealing with **bitfields**, **hashing**, or **performance-critical code** (embedded systems, cryptography, image processing).

| Task                                    | Bitwise Technique                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Set bit at position `i`                 | `num |= (1 << i)`                                      |
| Clear bit at position `i`               | `num &= ~(1 << i)`                                     |
| Toggle bit at position `i`              | `num ^= (1 << i)`                                      |
| Check bit at position `i`               | `(num & (1 << i)) != 0`                                |
| Multiply `n` by 2<sup>k</sup>           | `n << k`                                               |

| Check if `n` is power of 2              | `n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0`                         |
| Count set bits (Brian Kernighan‚Äôs algo) | `while n: count += 1; n &= (n - 1)`                    |
| Rightmost set bit position              | `pos = log2(n & -n) + 1`                               |
